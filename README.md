# Final Project

## Overview:
---

#### Selected Topic
- Covid-19 vaccination in the US
    - US adverse reactions to vaccines in 2021
    - `DataSet`: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) website

#### Reason of the selected topic
- Factors that have inspired our group to study this data and discover the real effects and implications of vaccines:
    - The global pandemic has entered a new stage through many countries receiving vaccines, and populations promptly vaccinating on a large scale. 
    - Recently, in March there has been controversial news surrounding the effects of these Covid vaccines, namely the AstroZenica vaccine in Europe.

#### Description of source of data
- Source data includes three CSV files containing information from individuals in the USA who file with the VAERS and report  adverse effects after receiving  a licensed vaccine. 
    - These CSV files contains the information regarding the individual, the symptoms experienced, and the vaccine taken.
    - The files contain data from 2021 `from Jan 1st until March 13th`.

#### Questions to answer by analyzing data 
- What characteristics do individuals share? 
- Who experience adverse reactions that result in death?
- Is there any correlation between our features and an adverse reaction/death?
- Are any groups more susceptible to experience an adverse reaction or death as a result of a Covid vaccination?
